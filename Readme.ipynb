    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images. There are 8792 vehicle images and 8968 non-vehicle images, which are well balanced on amounts, this avoids the overfitting to one side of prediction. Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",

    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.\n",

    "\n",
    "I tried multiple combinations of parameters and focused on the RGB, HSV and YCrCb colorscpaces. RGB as the baseline, HSV and YCrCb as targing color space. Tradeoff in parameters tuning is mainly focused on the accuracy and computational time on 10 predictions. A lower prediction time is more realistic in this real time processing scenario. A comparison of results are shown in the following table. \n",

    "I trained a linear SVM using selected HOG features, spatial binned color and color histogram. The classifier training code was implemented in the 6th cell under \"Train classifier\". I combined the three features in one function `extract features` and saved the results as `car_features` and `notcar_features`. 20% of the data were split as testing data using `sklearn.modelselection`. Before training, `StandardScaler()` was used to generate a scaler `Xscaler` to normalize and scale the training data. \n",

    "#### 2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately I searched on three scales using YCrCb channel-1 HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Two scales were used becaulse of the perspective issue. Vehicles near the camera are larger than the further ones. Therefore, a larger window (2.5) saved much simulation time. Different searching steps were used in different perspective as well.\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",

    "I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video. \n",
    "From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded (2) that map to identify vehicle positions.\n",

It might require more advanced search window algorithm and parallel computing techniques to make real-time processing possible. Reducing the interested region also speed up the computation. \n",
    "* Refine non-vehicle training data. The classifier still tends to recognize trees and barriers as vehicle. By including more common non-vehicle data set, the classifier might work better in the video. \n"
